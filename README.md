# Miscellaneous
This repository contains small and random scripts and projects that I have worked on. Below is a brief description of each one.

# professor.py
This is my take on the CS50 Little Professor project. I have not done the CS50 class but wanted to see if I could complete this without needing to.

# small.py
This is a collection of two small projects, one that is a simple higher or lower number game and the the other a program that prints ascending or descending number of stars according to the user input.
